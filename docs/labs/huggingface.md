# HuggingFace

HuggingFace is a "social media" site for AI developers.  It is similar to Facebook, but instead of connecting people to people, it connects models to many other things such as:

1. Datasets
2. Web Applications (Spaces)
3. Projects
4. Organizations
5. People
6. Architectures


## Models

[HuggingFace Models](https://huggingface.co/models)

Note the number of models and the popularity of models. 
Note the "faceted search" to narrow models by type.

## Spaces

Spaces are web applications that use an machine learning model.

They are written using Python Streamlit and Gradio libraries.  You can create your own applications by just doing a copy/paste of other code.
