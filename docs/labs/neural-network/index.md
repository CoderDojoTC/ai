# Generate a Neural Network Diagram Using ChatGPT

## First Prompt

```linenums="0"
Generate a p5.js file that draws a three-layer neural network. 
The input is on the left.  The output is on the right.
The layer on the left should be labeled "Input".
```

## Response

## Second Prompt

```linenums="0"
Add slider controls that change the number of layers and the number of neurons in a layer.
```

## Third Prompt

```linenums="0"
Add labels to the sliders.
Add a total parameter count at the bottom of the display.
The parameter count is the total number of weights and
biases in the neural network.
```

## Fourth Prompt

```linenums="0"
What is the formula for the total number of parameters in terms of
layers and neurons in a layer?
```
```
In a simple fully connected feedforward neural network with uniform layers (i.e., each layer has the same number of neurons), the total number of parameters is given by the sum of the weights and biases in the network. If 
�
n is the number of neurons in each layer, and 
�
L is the number of layers, then:

There are 
(
�
−
1
)
(L−1) sets of weights between layers. Each set of weights between two adjacent layers would have 
�
×
�
n×n parameters (weights).

Total Weights
=
(
�
−
1
)
×
�
×
�
Total Weights=(L−1)×n×n

Additionally, each layer (except the input layer) has 
�
n biases.

Total Biases
=
(
�
−
1
)
×
�
Total Biases=(L−1)×n

So, the total number of parameters is the sum of the weights and biases:

Total Parameters

Total Weights

Total Biases

(

)

Total Parameters=Total Weights+Total Biases=(L−1)×n×n+(L−1)×n
Total Parameters
=
(
�
−
1
)
×
�
×
(
�
+
1
)
Total Parameters=(L−1)×n×(n+1)
This formula assumes a simple neural network architecture where each layer has the same number of neurons. If the layers have varying numbers of neurons, the formula would need to be adjusted accordingly.
