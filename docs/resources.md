# Resources for teaching AI to Students Ages 8-18
We aspire to have a collection of AI activities for students
that are both safe and fun.  There are many AI demos available
but many of them are trained on a wide range of data that could
include adult content.  So we need to be cautious before we recommend
a specific site.

With that said, here are some demonstrations that can be both safe and
fun.  We hope you will try them out and let us know what activities are
useful in your mentoring and classrooms.

#### Quickdraw (with Google)
This fun game challenges kids to draw a picture of a named item.  The students
have 20 seconds to draw the item.  As they draw the computer says "I see X"
or "I see Y".  If the computer guesses correctly you go on to the next item.
You get six items in a session.  Sample items are cup, clock, cellphone, lighthouse, bear etc.

#### Teachable Machine

This Google site is a great way to teach simple machine learning to students.
Although it works on images and sounds, we use it mostly in the image mode.
The site assumes you have a web camera and can hold items up to the camera for
gathering training images.  Students can hold up apple, a cell phone and
a book and see if the computer can learn the images and then classify a new
image.

#### Google TensorFlow Playground

This site is excellent for helping you visualize
how neural networks classify object.  The interactive
tool allows you to change the number of neurons and
layers in a neural network and see how these changes
impact a simple classifier.

#### AI and Ethics for Middle School

This is a curriculum designed by MIT professor Blakeley H. Payne.
The curriculum focuses on topics such as training, classification and bias.

#### Chatbots for Kids
Chatbots can be fun, but there are many concerns about chatbots with feedback that
generate bias and adult content.  Althogh we m adult supervision for all chatbots, here is one that is relativly benign.

If you are interested in writing your own chatbot for a classroom activity, here are some guildlines:

#### Story Generation
We are continually looking for a kid safe version of an AI story generator.  If you have students that are 18 or older than you might try the Talk to Transformer
demonstration.  Since a small percent of their traning set is fan fiction that does
have adult content, please be careful.

#### Teaching AI Book
This book is written from the perspective of a teacher without a strong
background in AI.  It includes many useful references.

#### Conversational AI
Both chatbots and Alexa apps (called "skills") are examples of conversational AI.
Designing AI for the classroom is currently difficult.

#### Grammerly Tool - AI for checking your writing
The Grammerly tool can be used to not only check your grammer but it will also suggest alternate words and see if the tone of your document
matches your goals.

Note that there is a plugin for VSCode here:

#### TabNine - AI for compleating your code
The TabNine extension for your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a good example of using a predictive model to suggest what text should be next in a sentence.

## Videos

#### What is a neural network?
This has some of the best video production value of all the intoductary videos
on deep learning.  
It is part of the high quality [Three Blue One Brown series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) set of videos done by [Grant Sanderson](https://www.3blue1brown.com/about) of Stanford University and the Kahn Academy.  The videos include many animated visual explainations that use both motion and color to describe mathematics.
The example used is the popular MNIST digit recognition example.  What we call the "Hello world" of AI.  It walks though the process of representing digits in a 28X28 matrix of values for each digit and passing the images through a deep learing neural network.
This video covers the concepts of image recognition, digit recognition, image pixels, pixel brightness, neural network, input layers, hidden layers, output layers, activation, probability, decomposition, training, weighted sums, normalization, the sigmoid function, bias, parameter counting (weights and bias), vector representations, matrix representations, linear algebra, transformation functions.
