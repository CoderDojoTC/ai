# Resources for teaching AI to Students Ages 8-18

#### Teachable Machine
This Google site is a great way to teach simple machine learning to students.
Although it works on images and sounds, we use it mostly in the image mode.
The site assumes you have a web camera and can hold items up to the camera for
gathering training images.  Students can hold up apple, a cell phone and
a book and see if the computer can learn the images and then classify a new
image.

#### Google Tensorflow Playground
This site is excellent for helping you visualize
how neural networks classify object.  The interactive
tool allows you to change the number of neurons and
layers in a neural network and see how these changes
impact a simple classifier.
