# Teaching AI Concepts to Students 8-18

A repository for mentors who would like to teach AI to kids 8-18.  It contains lesson plans and resources to make understanding AI, Machine Learning and Prediction fun and easy to understand for a wide variety of ages and backgrounds.

## Key Concepts
Here are some key concepts we will be learning in this course.  Theses
questions and answers are just the beginning of our understanding of the
areas around AI.

### What is AI?
In this courese, We will define AI is the ability to learn rules from data and make predictins about the future.  We will contrast AI systems from
systems where we write the rules on our own.  We will learn how to
teach computers how to classify images and sounds.

### What is Prediction?
Prediction is using data from the past to figure out the probability of something in the future.  Prediciton is the central thing we do in AI and specificlly machine learning.

### What is Recomentation?
Recomendation is a prediction of if a person will like a specific action.  When we
search for a page in a search engine like Google, the search engine is predicting what web pages it thinks we would like to see.

### What is Machine Learning?

### How is Machine Learning Different from Codeing?

### What is Training?

### What is Bias?

### What is Explainability?

### When do recomendations need to be explainable?

### What is a Neural Network?

### What is Deep Learning?
