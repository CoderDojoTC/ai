#### Hallucination
In the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP), hallucination refers to the phenomenon where a model generates output that is not grounded in its input data, often resulting in false or nonsensical information.

#### Heuristic
A problem-solving technique that employs a practical method to find a sufficient, though not always optimal, solution.

#### Model Parameter Count
The total number of trainable parameters within a machine learning model, often cited as a measure of model complexity.

#### Moore's Law
The observation that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every two years, leading to an exponential increase in computing power.

Moore's law also applies to specialized AI hardware.

#### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
A field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language.

#### Overfitting
A modeling error in machine learning where a function fits the training data too closely, reducing its performance on new, unseen data.

#### Reference Frame
Structures in the human brain that allow the brain to understand the structure of something.

Reference frames allow people to understand objects and allow for planning and movements.  Reference frames are also used to store abstract concepts.

#### Reinforcement Learning
A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to achieve a goal.

#### Supervised Learning
A machine learning paradigm where the algorithm learns from labeled training data, and makes predictions based on that data.

#### Unsupervised Learning
A machine learning paradigm where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data, without a specific task like classification or prediction.

#### Perceptron
A type of artificial neuron or node used in a neural network, which takes a set of inputs and produces an output by applying a set of weights and an activation function.

#### Test Set
A subset of the data set used to assess the performance of a fully-trained machine learning model.
