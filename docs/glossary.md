# Glossary of AI Terms

#### Algorithm
A set of step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem or performing a task.

#### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

#### Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
A computing model inspired by biological neural networks, designed to recognize patterns.

#### Backpropagation
An algorithm for adjusting the weights in a neural network based on the error in the output.

#### Bias
1. In machine learning, a term that describes the skewness in data or algorithmic decisions.
2. In neural networks, a constant added to a weighted sum before the activation function.

#### Classification
A type of supervised learning where an algorithm categorizes input data into predefined classes.

#### Clustering
A type of unsupervised learning that groups similar data points together based on their features.

#### Data Mining
The process of discovering patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data.

#### Data Set
A collection of related data points used for the purposes of analysis or training machine learning models.

#### Deep Learning
A subset of machine learning involving algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.

#### Heuristic
A problem-solving technique that employs a practical method to find a sufficient, though not always optimal, solution.

#### Model File
A file that contains a neural network.

#### Machine Learning (ML)
A subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without explicit programming.

#### Model Collapse

When new generative models train on AI-generated content and gradually degenerate as a result.

#### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
A field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language.

#### Reinforcement Learning
A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to achieve a goal.

#### Supervised Learning
A machine learning paradigm where the algorithm learns from labeled training data, and makes predictions based on that data.

#### Unsupervised Learning
A machine learning paradigm where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data, without a specific task like classification or prediction.

#### Overfitting
A modeling error in machine learning where a function fits the training data too closely, reducing its performance on new, unseen data.

#### Perceptron
A type of artificial neuron or node used in a neural network, which takes a set of inputs and produces an output by applying a set of weights and an activation function.

#### Training Set
A subset of a data set used to train a machine learning model.

#### Validation Set
A subset of a data set used to assess the performance of a machine learning model during the training phase, but is not used for training itself.
