The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

#### Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
A computing model inspired by biological neural networks, designed to recognize patterns.

#### Backpropagation
An algorithm for adjusting the weights in a neural network based on the error in the output.

#### Batch Size
The number of training examples utilized in one iteration during the training of a neural network.

#### Bias
1. In machine learning, a term that describes the skewness in data or algorithmic decisions.

#### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
A field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language.

#### Overfitting
A modeling error in machine learning where a function fits the training data too closely, reducing its performance on new, unseen data.

#### Reinforcement Learning
A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to achieve a goal.

#### Supervised Learning
A machine learning paradigm where the algorithm learns from labeled training data, and makes predictions based on that data.

#### Unsupervised Learning
A machine learning paradigm where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data, without a specific task like classification or prediction.

#### Perceptron
A type of artificial neuron or node used in a neural network, which takes a set of inputs and produces an output by applying a set of weights and an activation function.

#### Training Set
A subset of a data set used to train a machine learning model.

#### Validation Set
A subset of a data set used to assess the performance of a machine learning model during the training phase, but is not used for training itself.


#### Genetic Algorithm
A search heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection, used to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems.

#### Hyperparameter
A parameter whose value is set before the training process begins, influencing the performance of the machine learning model.

#### Inference
The process of using a trained machine learning model to make predictions or decisions.

#### K-Means
A clustering algorithm that partitions a data set into 'K' number of clusters.

#### Loss Function
A function that calculates the difference between the predicted output and the actual label in supervised learning.

#### Overfitting
A modeling error where a machine learning algorithm captures noise in the training data, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data.

#### Precision and Recall
Metrics used to evaluate the quality of models in classification tasks, especially where imbalances or specific costs are associated with errors.

#### Query
A request for data or information from a database, often in the context of data retrieval or modification.

#### Random Forest
An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees.

#### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
An optimization algorithm often used for finding the minimum of a function, commonly used in machine learning algorithms.

#### Test Set
A subset of the data set used to assess the performance of a fully-trained machine learning model.

#### Underfitting
A modeling error where a machine learning algorithm cannot capture the underlying trend in the data, resulting in poor performance.

#### Vector
An ordered list of numbers, often used to represent a data point in machine learning.
