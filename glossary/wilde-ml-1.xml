        <h4>Activation Function</h4>
        <p>To allow Neural Networks to learn complex decision boundaries, we apply a nonlinear
            activation function to some of its layers. Commonly used functions include <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">sigmoid</a>, <a

        <h4>Adadelta</h4>
        <p>Adadelta is a gradient descent based learning algorithm that adapts the learning rate per
            parameter over time. It was proposed as an improvement over <a href="#adagrad"
                >Adagrad</a>, which is more sensitive to hyperparameters and may decrease the
            learning rate too aggressively. Adadelta It is similar to <a href="#rmsprop">rmsprop</a>
            and can be used instead of vanilla <a href="#sgd">SGD</a>.</p>

        <p>Adagrad is an adaptive learning rate algorithms that keeps track of the squared gradients
            over time and automatically adapts the learning rate per-parameter. It can be used
            instead of vanilla SGD and is particularly helpful for sparse data, where it assigns a
            higher learning rate to infrequently updated parameters.</p>

        <p>A fully-connected layer in a Neural Network. Affine means that each neuron in the
            previous layer is connected to each neuron in the current layer. In many ways, this is
            the “standard” layer of a Neural Network. Affine layers are often added on top of the
            outputs of <a href="#cnn">Convolutional Neural Networks</a> or <a href="#rnn">Recurrent
                Neural Networks</a> before making a final prediction. An affine layer is typically
            of the form <code>y = f(Wx + b)</code> where <code>x</code> are the layer inputs,
                <code>W</code> the parameters, <code>b</code> a bias vector, and <code>f</code> a

            specific parts of an image. Attention mechanisms can be incorporated in both Language
            Processing and Image Recognition architectures to help the network learn what to “focus”

        <h4>Alexnet</h4>
        <p>Alexnet is the name of the Convolutional Neural Network architecture that won the ILSVRC
            2012 competition by a large margin and was responsible for a resurgence of interest in
            CNNs for Image Recognition. It consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are
            followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way
            softmax. Alexnet was introduced in <a

            <a name="autoencoder"/>
        </p>
        <h4>Autoencoder</h4>
        <p>An Autoencoder is a Neural Network model whose goal is to predict the input itself,
            typically through a “bottleneck” somewhere in the network. By introducing a bottleneck,
            we force the network to learn a lower-dimensional representation of the input,
            effectively compressing the input into a good representation. Autoencoders are related
            to PCA and other dimensionality reduction techniques, but can learn more complex
            mappings due to their nonlinear nature. A wide range of autoencoder architectures exist,
            including <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume11/vincent10a/vincent10a.pdf"

        <p>Average-Pooling is a <a href="#pooling">pooling</a> technique used in Convolutional
            Neural Networks for Image Recognition. It works by sliding a window over patches of
            features, such as pixels, and taking the average of all values within the window. It
            compresses the input representation into a lower-dimensional representation.</p>

        <h4>Backpropagation</h4>
        <p>Backpropagation is an algorithm to efficiently calculate the gradients in a Neural
            Network, or more generally, a feedforward computational graph. It boils down to applying
            the chain rule of differentiation starting from the network output and propagating the
            gradients backward. The first uses of backpropagation go back to Vapnik in the 1960’s,
            but <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v323/n6088/abs/323533a0.html">
                Learning representations by back-propagating errors</a> is often cited as the

        <p>Backpropagation Through Time (<a
                href="http://axon.cs.byu.edu/~martinez/classes/678/Papers/Werbos_BPTT.pdf"
            >paper</a>) is the <a href="#backpropagation">Backpropagation algorithm</a> applied to
            Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). BPTT can be seen as the standard backpropagation
            algorithm applied to an RNN, where each time step represents a layer and the parameters
            are shared across layers. Because an RNN shares the same parameters across all time
            steps, the errors at one time step must be backpropagated “through time” to all previous
            time steps, hence the name. When dealing with long sequences (hundreds of inputs), a
            truncated version of BPTT is often used to reduce the computational cost. Truncated BPTT
            stops backpropagating the errors after a fixed number of steps.</p>

        <p>Batch Normalization is a technique that normalizes layer inputs per mini-batch. It speed
            up training, allows for the usage of higher learner rates, and can act as a regularizer.
            Batch Normalization has been found to be very effective for Convolutional and
            Feedforward Neural Networks but hasn’t been successfully applied to Recurrent Neural

        <p>A Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network is a type of Neural Network that contains two <a

            input sequence from start to end, while the backward RNN reads it from end to start. The
            two RNNs are stacked on top of each others and their states are typically combined by
            appending the two vectors. Bidirectional RNNs are often used in Natural Language
            problems, where we want to take the context from both before and after a word into
            account before making a prediction.</p>

            two probability distributions, typically the true labels and the predicted labels. It is
            given by <code>L = -sum(y * log(y_prediction))</code> where <code>y</code> is the
            probability distribution of true labels (typically a one-hot vector) and

        <p>An embedding maps an input representation, such as a word or sentence, into a vector. A
            popular type of embedding are word embeddings such as <a href="#word2vec">word2vec</a>
            or <a href="#glove">GloVe</a>. We can also embed sentences, paragraphs or images. For
            example, by mapping images and their textual descriptions into a common embedding space
            and minimizing the distance between them, we can match labels with images. Embeddings
            can be learned explicitly, such as in <a href="#word2vec">word2vec</a>, or as part of a
            supervised task, such as Sentiment Analysis. Often, the input layer of a network is

            according to <code>new_gradients = gradients * threshold /

        <p>A Highway Layer (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00387">paper</a>) is a type of Neural
            Network layer that uses a gating mechanism to control the information flow through a
            layer. Stacking multiple Highway Layers allows for training of very deep networks.
            Highway Layers work by learning a gating function that chooses which parts of the inputs
            to pass through and which parts to pass through a transformation function, such as a
            standard <a href="#affine-layer">affine</a> layer for example. The basic formulation of
            a Highway Layer is <code>T * h(x) + (1 - T) * x</code>, where <code>T</code> is the
            learned gating function with values between 0 and 1, <code>h(x)</code> is an arbitrary
            input transformation and <code>x</code> is the input. Note that all of these must have

        <h4>Max-Pooling</h4>
        <p>A <a href="#pooling">pooling</a> operations typically used in Convolutional Neural
            Networks. A max-pooling layer selects the maximum value from a patch of features. Just
            like a convolutional layer, pooling layers are parameterized by a window (patch) size
            and stride size. For example, we may slide a window of size 2×2 over a 10×10 feature
            matrix using stride size 2, selecting the max across all 4 values within each window,
            resulting in a new 5×5 feature matrix. Pooling layers help to reduce the dimensionality
            of a representation by keeping only the most salient information, and in the case of
            image inputs, they provide basic invariance to translation (the same maximum values will
            be selected even if the image is shifted by a few pixels). Pooling layers are typically
            inserted between successive convolutional layers.</p>

        <h4>Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)</h4>
        <p>A RNN models sequential interactions through a hidden state, or memory. It can take up to
            N inputs and produce up to N outputs. For example, an input sequence may be a sentence
            with the outputs being the part-of-speech tag for each word (N-to-N). An input could be
            a sentence, and the output a sentiment classification of the sentence (N-to-1). An input
            could be a single image, and the output could be a sequence of words corresponding to
            the description of an image (1-to-N). At each time step, an RNN calculates a new hidden
            state (“memory”) based on the current input and the previous hidden state. The
            “recurrent” stems from the facts that at each step the same parameters are used and the
            network performs the same calculations based on different inputs.</p>

        <h4>ResNet</h4>
        <p>Deep Residual Networks won the ILSVRC 2015 challenge. These networks work by introducing
            shortcut connection across stacks of layers, allowing the optimizer to learn “easier”
            residual mappings instead of the more complicated original mappings. These shortcut
            connections are similar to <a href="#highway-layer">Highway Layers</a>, but they are
            data-independent and don’t introduce additional parameters or training complexity.
            ResNets achieved a 3.57% error rate on the ImageNet test set.</p>

        <h4>Seq2Seq</h4>
        <p>A Sequence-to-Sequence model reads a sequence (such as a sentence) as an input and
            produces another sequence as an output. It differs from a standard <a href="#rnn"
                >RNN</a> in that the input sequence is completely read before the network starts
            producing any output. Typically, seq2seq models are implemented using two RNNs,
            functioning as encoders and decoders. <a href="#nmt">Neural Machine Translation</a> is a
            typical example of a seq2seq model.</p>

        <p>Stochastic Gradient Descent (<a

            gradient-based optimization algorithm that is used to learn network parameters during
            the training phase. The gradients are typically calculated using the <a
                href="#backpropagation">backpropagation</a> algorithm. In practice, people use the
            minibatch version of SGD, where the parameter updates are performed based on a batch
            instead of a single example, increasing computational efficiency. Many extensions to
            vanilla SGD exist, including <a href="#momentym">Momentum</a>, <a href="#adagrad"

        <h4>Softmax</h4>
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function">softmax function</a> is
            typically used to convert a vector of raw scores into class probabilities at the output
            layer of a Neural Network used for classification. It normalizes the scores by
            exponentiating and dividing by a normalization constant. If we are dealing with a large
            number of classes, a large vocabulary in Machine Translation for example, the
            normalization constant is expensive to compute. There exist various alternatives to make
            the computation more efficient, including <a
                href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amnih/papers/hlbl_final.pdf">Hierarchical
                Softmax</a> or using a sampling-based loss such as <a href="#nce">NCE</a>.</p>

        </p>
        <h4>Vanishing Gradient Problem</h4>
        <p>The vanishing gradient problem arises in very deep Neural Networks, typically Recurrent
            Neural Networks, that use activation functions whose gradients tend to be small (in the
            range of 0 from 1). Because these small gradients are multiplied during backpropagation,
            they tend to “vanish” throughout the layers, preventing the network from learning
            long-range dependencies. Common ways to counter this problem is to use activation
            functions like <a href="#relu">ReLUs</a> that do not suffer from small gradients, or use
            architectures like <a href="#lstm">LSTMs</a> that explicitly combat vanishing gradients.
            The opposite of this problem is called the <a href="#exploding-gradient-problem"
                >exploding gradient problem</a>.</p>

            learn word <a href="#embedding">embeddings</a> by trying to predict the context of words
            in a document. The resulting word vectors have some interesting properties, for example

            Two different objectives can be used to learn these embeddings: The Skip-Gram objective
            tries to predict a context from on a word, and the CBOW objective tries to predict a
            word from its context.</p>
