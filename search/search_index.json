Although it works on images and sounds, we use it mostly in the image mode. The site assumes you have a web camera and can hold items up to the camera for gathering training images. Students can hold up apple, a cell phone and a book and see if the computer can learn the images and then classify a new image. Teachable Machine Google Tensorflow Playground This site is excellent for helping you visualize how neural networks classify object. The interactive tool allows you to change the number of neurons and layers in a neural network and see how these changes impact a simple classifier.
