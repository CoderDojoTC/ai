Key Concepts Here are some key concepts we will be learning in this course. Theses questions and answers are just the beginning of our understanding of the areas around AI. What is AI? In this courese, We will define AI is the ability to learn rules from data and make predictins about the future. We will contrast AI systems from systems where we write the rules on our own. We will learn how to teach computers how to classify images and sounds. What is Prediction? Prediction is using data from the past to figure out the probability of something in the future. Prediciton is the central thing we do in AI and specificlly machine learning. What is Recomentation? Recomendation is a prediction of if a person will like a specific action. When we search for a page in a search engine like Google, the search engine is predicting what web pages it thinks we would like to see. What is Machine Learning? How is Machine Learning Different from Codeing? What is Training? What is Bias? What is Explainability? When do recomendations need to be explainable? What is a Neural Network? What is Deep Learning?

There are many AI demos available but many of them are trained on a wide range of data that could include adult content. So we need to be cautious before we recommend a specific site. With that said, here are some demonstrations that can be both safe and fun. We hope you will try them out and let us know what activities are useful in your mentoring and classrooms. Quickdraw (with Google) This fun game challenges kids to draw a picture of a named item. The students have 20 seconds to draw the item. As they draw the computer says \"I see X\" or \"I see Y\". If the computer guesses correctly you go on to the next item. You get six items in a session. Sample items are cup, clock, cellphone, lighthouse, bear etc. QuickDraw website Teachable Machine This Google site is a great way to teach simple machine learning to students. Although it works on images and sounds, we use it mostly in the image mode. The site assumes you have a web camera and can hold items up to the camera for gathering training images. Students can hold up apple, a cell phone and a book and see if the computer can learn the images and then classify a new image. Teachable Machine Google TensorFlow Playground This site is excellent for helping you visualize how neural networks classify object. The interactive tool allows you to change the number of neurons and layers in a neural network and see how these changes impact a simple classifier. Google TensorFlow Playground AI and Ethics for Middle School This is a curriculum designed by MIT professor Blakeley H. Payne. The curriculum focuses on topics such as training, classification and bias. AI for Middle School (Course Description() AI for Middle School (Google Docs) Chatbots for Kids Chatbots can be fun, but there are many concerns about chatbots with feedback that generate bias and adult content. Althogh we m adult supervision for all chatbots, here is one that is relativly benign. https://www.pandorabots.com/mitsuku/ If you are interested in writing your own chatbot for a classroom activity, here are some guildlines: Chatbot Design for Kids Story Generation We are continually looking for a kid safe version of an AI story generator. If you have students that are 18 or older than you might try the Talk to Transformer demonstration. Since a small percent of their traning set is fan fiction that does have adult content, please be careful. Talk to Transformer (the free version currently shut down) Teaching AI Book This book is written from the perspective of a teacher without a strong background in AI. It includes many useful references. Teaching AI: Exploring New Frontiers for Learning by Michelle Zimmerman Conversational AI Both chatbots and Alexa apps (called \"skills\") are examples of conversational AI. Designing AI for the classroom is currently difficult. Amazon Alexa Confersational AI Grammerly Tool - AI for checking your writing The Grammerly tool can be used to not only check your grammer but it will also suggest alternate words and see if the tone of your document matches your goals. Grammerly Note that there is a plugin for VSCode here: Grammerly VSCode Plugin TabNine - AI for compleating your code The TabNine extension for your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a good example of using a predictive model to suggest what text should be next in a sentence. TabNine Videos What is a neural network? This has some of the best video production value of all the intoductary videos on deep learning. It is part of the high quality Three Blue One Brown series set of videos done by Grant Sanderson of Stanford University and the Kahn Academy. The videos include many animated visual explainations that use both motion and color to describe mathematics. The example used is the popular MNIST digit recognition example. What we call the \"Hello world\" of AI. It walks though the process of representing digits in a 28X28 matrix of values for each digit and passing the images through a deep learing neural network. This video covers the concepts of image recognition, digit recognition, image pixels, pixel brightness, neural network, input layers, hidden layers, output layers, activation, probability, decomposition, training, weighted sums, normalization, the sigmoid function, bias, parameter counting (weights and bias), vector representations, matrix representations, linear algebra, transformation functions.
