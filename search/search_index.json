Key Concepts Here are some key concepts we will be learning in this course. Theses questions and answers are just the beginning of our understanding of the areas around AI. What is AI? In this courese, We will define AI is the ability to learn rules from data and make predictins about the future. We will contrast AI systems from systems where we write the rules on our own. We will learn how to teach computers how to classify images and sounds. What is Prediction? Prediction is using data from the past to figure out the probability of something in the future. Prediciton is the central thing we do in AI and specificlly machine learning. What is Recomentation? Recomendation is a prediction of if a person will like a specific action. When we search for a page in a search engine like Google, the search engine is predicting what web pages it thinks we would like to see. What is Machine Learning? How is Machine Learning Different from Codeing? What is Training? What is Bias? What is Explainability? When do recomendations need to be explainable? What is a Neural Network? What is Deep Learning?

Although it works on images and sounds, we use it mostly in the image mode. The site assumes you have a web camera and can hold items up to the camera for gathering training images. Students can hold up apple, a cell phone and a book and see if the computer can learn the images and then classify a new image. Teachable Machine Google Tensorflow Playground This site is excellent for helping you visualize how neural networks classify object. The interactive tool allows you to change the number of neurons and layers in a neural network and see how these changes impact a simple classifier. Google Tensorflow Playground AI and Ethings for Middle School This is a cirriculum designed by MIT professor Blakeley H. Payne. The cirriculum focuses on topics such as training, classification and bias.
